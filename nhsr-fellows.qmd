# NHS-R Community Fellowship {.unnumbered}

## Purpose

NHS-R Community gives the honorary title of Fellow in recognition and acknowledgement to those members of the NHS-R Community who have made a significant contribution to the Community. 

Examples of contribution may be creating a workshop; running workshops; being on the NHS-R Committee meetings; submitting several blogs or contributing significantly to code hosted through NHS-R Community. 

It is also a way for active members to be able to refer to their commitment to NHS-R Community in social media and/or on CVs. Because the Fellowship is given to members who are active in the Community there is no restriction on membership (core or fringe), time involved with the community or working in any particular industry or organisation. 

## Use of Fellow title

As an honorary title, those awarded Fellowship are at liberty to use it as they see appropriate. It is expected that Fellows will be aware of, promote and follow the NHS-R Community Code of Conduct when contributing to any NHS-R Community events.

Fellows agree to their name and organisation (if appropriate as Fellows can be students or not currently in work) at the time of nomination, being promoted through the NHS-R Community website for 3 years, after which their Fellowship will be reviewed by the NHS-R Community Committee for renewal or details removed from the website. We ask that details are updated in personal areas to reflect this or refer to being a Previous Fellow. 

## Becoming a Fellow

All members of the [NHS-R Community Committee](nhsr-committee.qmd) will be a Fellow and membership of the Committee itself is subject to membership conditions which need to be fulfilled for this title.

Nominations for Fellows will be brought to the NHS-R Community Committee and discussions on Fellowship approval will be noted in the minutes. Where Fellowship is discussed and not agreed this will be given back to the nominee and will not be recorded formally.

Nominations can be from anyone, for themselves or on behalf of someone else, and they do not have to currently be on the Committee or a Fellow. The nomination will be via email to [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net) giving the following details:

-	Name
-	Organisation
-	Details and publicly shareable links to work and activities completed in the name of or on behalf of NHS-R Community. These activities should be in the open, reflect the Code of Conduct of the NHS-R Way and be numerous. For example, writing a blog is a great way to contribute to the community but to be seen as a Fellow of NHS-R Community several blogs will need to be published on the NHS-R Community website.
 
The committee will review nominations as they are submitted and they can be throughout the year.
