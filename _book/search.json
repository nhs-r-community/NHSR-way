    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the NHS-R Community Way book to the NHS-R Community based on The Turing Way guides and Community Handbook. Like The Turing Way, this is an open source, open collaboration, and community-driven project. We are called NHS-R Community but our contributors come from Local Authorities, Civil Service, Public Sector, Academia, Voluntary Sector, Charities and as individuals with no organisational connection. Our goal is to promote R - extended to data science tools - and to do this in an open way by supporting and promoting open code sharing which includes other media content like videos of our workshops and conferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to start?\n\n\n\nThis book is not meant to be read from start to finish and we recommend that you read the Code of Conduct first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in two ways\n\n\n\nThe NHS-R Way is published on GitHub and on Netlify because some organisations block one or the other through their Virtual Private Networks.\n\n\n\n\nOur Community\nThe NHS-R Community started in 2018 to promote the use of R in the NHS and the community has grown rapidly ever since. It is a community that is broader than the NHS as members come from public sector organisations across the UK, including Local Authorities and Civil Service, as well as academics and voluntary sector people who have an interest in healthcare. Whilst R is a core language for support by the community, there is always support for data science tools more generally, particularly where they cross over with R.\nDocumentation is important in coding to show methodology as well as intention so the NHS-R Community Way, inspired from The Turing Way, is our attempt to write about the Community.\nThe NHS-R Community Way reflects our:\n\nvalues\nactivities\nabove all the community\n\nEverything here is available for free under a CC-BY licence. Please use and re-use whatever you need, for any purpose and all the book is collaboratively written and open from the start. To make this book and the community truly accessible to everyone, we invite you to contribute your skills and bring your perspectives into this project. Write and issue, do a pull request or even NHS-R Community.\nThe NHS-R Community initially received funding for its activities but is now completely reliant upon volunteers. There is no restriction to who you work for, what your background is or what skills you have as we are the sum of all our parts and the more diverse and varied we are, the better our work together will be. The NHS-R Community is now hosted by the Strategy Unit, part of NHS Lancashire Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit, which includes some administrative support, the hosting of an (nhs.net?) email and two data scientists roles with NHS-R Community in their job descriptions. Over the years the NHS-R Community has been involved in many activities from blogs to podcasts.\nWe value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the NHS-R Way project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times. All contributions must abide by our code of conduct.\n\n\nHistory\nThis book is based on The Turing Way book which was started as a technical guide. Like the NHS-R Community projects we also have a need to pull together information on how to contribute to the projects but not all our projects are technical. As a community we have developed many channels of collaboration and communication through blogs, social media, podcasts and videos. This content needs a central point to promote it but also a way to explain how to get involved and contribute at whatever stage in your data science journey - hence the NHS-R Community way.\n\n\nCiting the NHS-R Community Way\nAll material produced and shared by the NHS-R Community is available under open licences for reuse and this book is available under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. We ask that you also read and, maybe, also refer to The Turing Way project in your work as it was immensely helpful in getting this project set up and is a great resource worthy of continued citation."

    "text": "2 Introduction\nThe NHS-R Community Way is a community-oriented and -led project, although supported through the NHS it is not exclusively open to just NHS employees and, as such, we have members from other public sector organisations, academia, charities, the voluntary sector as well as individuals who have an interest in healthcare data and data science. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our in-person events and online communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times.\nTo make clear what is expected, everyone participating in activities associated with the NHS-R Community and the NHS-R Community Way project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NHS-R Community including, but not limited to, in-person meetings, conferences, workshops, and communications online via GitHub and the NHS-R Community Slack.\nPresentation slides and posters should not contain material that does not follow this Code of Conduct, for example, anything offensive or sexualised. If this material is impossible to avoid given the topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the existence of this material should be noted in the abstract and, in the case of oral contributions, at the start of the talk or session. If the slides are shared or hosted by NHS-R Community, these should also contain a covering slide and details in the README to highlight the inclusion of this content.\nThe NHS-R Community has a core development team which consists of:\nThe central email nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net is accessed by Chris Beeley, Zoë Turner and administrative/support staff in the Strategy Unit.\nBoth Chris Beeley and Zoë Turner are employees of NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Strategy Unit and are not excluded from this Code of Conduct but, if required, contact can be made with the Senior Management team within the Strategy Unit in the same organisation through strategy.unit@nhs.net which neither have access to.\nThe NHS-R Community Way team are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, class or experience level.\nEveryone who participates in the NHS-R Community activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NHS-R Community including, but not limited to, in person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub and the NHS-R Slack group. By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the NHS-R Community resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information as well as sharing of that information with organisations.\nThis enforcement manual is used when we respond to an issue to make sure we’re consistent and fair. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.\nThe majority of this Code of Conduct code is adapted from The Turing Way Code of Conduct under the creative commons attribution license.\nSome parts have been added from the Code of Conduct that was originally list on the NHS-R Community website and had acknowledgements: SRCCON This code of conduct was based on that developed for useR! 2018 which was a revision of the code of conduct used at previous useR!s and also drew from rOpenSci’s code of conduct.. Exact text added can be found related to issue 11 on the GitHub.\nWe really appreciate the work that all of the communities that helped build The Turing Way, with credit particularly to Kirstie Whitaker. The Turing Way acknowledged many communities in their work and we also extend our appreciation to those groups and individuals (listed below). The ease of producing this comprehensive Code of Conduct is because of the acknowledged work being published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0 CA). This too is released under the same licence which means you are free to share and adapt the work so long as the attribution to and the NHS-R Community is retained, along with the attribution to The Turing Way, the Carpentries, the Alan Turing Institute Data Study Group organising team, Citizen Lab and the other resources."

    "text": "2.1 Expected Behaviour\nWe are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:\n\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.\nUse welcoming and inclusive language. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.\nDo not harass people. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.\nRespect the privacy and safety of others. Do not take photographs or screen shares of others without their permission. Do not share other participant’s personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (“doxing”) is a form of harassment.\nBe considerate of others’ participation. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.\nDon’t be a bystander. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.\nAs an overriding general rule, please be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes.\n\nAll interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. See this explanation of the four social rules - no feigning surprise, no well-actuallys, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours."

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of the core development team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund if a cost has been incurred), or impose any other appropriate sanctions (see the enforcement manual for details).\nIt may be that behaviour deemed unacceptable within the NHS-R Community does not necessarily correspond to regulations or policies from hosting organisations to an event or to the organisation (where applicable) that a person is representing. Under these circumstances we expect that any missing behaviours from either organisation or group are respected but that the NHS-R Community Code of Conduct is adhered to and amended to include any missing behaviours as soon as possible."

If the committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, Zoë Turner, as lead investigator of the NHS-R Community Way project, will break the tie. If Zoë Turner is unable to take part in the discussion due to a conflict of interest, Chris Beeley, as a second member of the Code of Conduct committee, will make the decision.\nPossible responses may include:\n\nA mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community members.\nA request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member.\nA public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the Code of Conduct.\nNothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the scope of this Code of Conduct.\nA private in-person conversation between a member of the team and the individual(s) involved. In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.\nA private written reprimand from a member of the research team to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the research team member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net for record keeping.\nA public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. on the listserv for a listserv violation; GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.). The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.\nAn imposed “time out” from online spaces. Zoë Turner and Chris Beeley will communicate this “time out” to the individual(s) involved.\nA permanent or temporary ban from some or all NHS-R Community project spaces (GitHub, in-person events etc). The research team will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or otherwise maintained. If a member of the community is removed from an event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they miss.\n\nOnce a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The Code of Conduct committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the Code of Conduct committee is not required to act on this feedback."

However, we can delete any old account to avoid confusion to others on the Slack so they will only tag or direct message the active account.\nOther than this situation, we would only ever delete an account due to Chapter 2 issues.\n\n\nSlack security\nAdministrators on the Slack can see email addresses and we can bulk email, however, we do not and have not used emails to contact people in bulk. Emails are not visible to others on the Slack workspace but people can Direct Message (DM) and those messages are not visible to administrators.\nIn line with good security principles we strongly suggest using two factor authentication for the Slack group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will need this for each Slack workspace that you have joined."

The meeting is moved to a Tuesday when England has a public holiday on the Monday and these changes are announced in the Slack group. The weekly office hours are for anyone to come along, without needing to schedule, with any issues with R or RStudio as part of the NHS-R Community. The meetings are run by Chris Beeley, Zoë Turner and Tom Jemmett on a rotating basis and is open to anyone who wishes to support this in the community. We keep a record of the upcoming meetings in a Google sheet.\nYou are also free to come for a chat!"

As Posit Cloud is hosted in the US this is used only for training where data is publicly available and the recommendation is to never use the Cloud for analysis of any sensitive data.\nThe Posit Cloud account is monitored and maintained by admins who have access to all projects and individual’s projects in the workspaces.

    "text": "Prework for attendees\n\nEquipment - screens\nMany of the course and workshop formats expect a “code along” approach which is best done with 2 screens for comfort of moving between the demonstration and using RStudio on your computer.\nWhere users use two separate computers to enable having 2 screens, this may cause issues with sharing code in the chat functions and it will not be possible to share the coding screen for debugging support. If the person is using a Posit Cloud workspace and the course leader is an administrator then the course leader can access the project to debug.\n\n\nSet up Posit Cloud\nSign up for a free Posit Cloud account at https://posit.cloud/ before the workshop. Log in with either an existing Google or GitHub account, or alternatively set up an account directly with Posit Cloud.\nNHS-R Community will send an email confirmation that will include the specific Posit Cloud work space invitation link.\nAll the files and necessary packages are pre-loaded to the Cloud work space.\nWhen you first log in with the link shared in the email it will take you to an Posit Cloud screen that says about Joining a space. Click on the blue button for Join Space:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the work space view in R Studio Cloud\n\n\nThe next screen that loads is a welcome page to the workshop and the final screen will have a project in it that, in this example, is called Intro_R_RStudio. When this is selected the project gets copied so you will see both the original Intro_R_RStudio and your own new one called Untitled. Although the word continue appears next to the original screen you will open your copy.\n\n\nDifference between NHS-R workspaces and your own\nYou will be restricted to a certain number of hours a month on the free account which should be enough for the purpose of a day workshop, however, the NHS-R work space doesn’t, currently, have that restriction.\n\n\nTaking the scripts to your own workspace\nTo move the project you’ve created to your own work space (which is available with the account you set up) select the moving trolley icon:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the project name and to the right 4 icons, the bin for delete, moving trolley, the down arrow to download and three dots in a circle\n\n\nThen select Your work space. If you’ve been invited to any other work space you will also see them in the same Move Content screen:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Move Content wizard with 3 options, Your work space and two others from NHS-R\n\n\nIt’s possible to download your files instead by using the down arrow by the Project.\n\n\nUsing your own laptop/computer\nSome VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) block access to Posit Cloud or you may wish to use your own computer. VPNs sometimes do work but block parts of the R functionality, this is particularly a problem with Shiny apps.\nIf that is the case please ensure you have the latest R and RStudio installed.\nIt is important to have the latest R installed as older versions of R have had issues when installing {tidyverse} packages. Errors say that packages like broom or readr cannot be installed but even when this has been installed separately there continue to be other errors. Some of the answers in this post from Posit community may help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you require permission for programs to be installed on your computer by an IT department, it is worth getting agreement to also have these updated by your IT department regularly or by request as it is always good practice for fixing issues and bugs.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling packages\nIf a course expects an introductory understanding of R then package requirements to be loaded will be shared. Courses like the Introduction to R and RStudio will install packages as part of the course.\n\n\nCourse materials\nMaterials produced by and for NHSR Community will be available through GitHub. However, some workshops are provided with course material available through Posit Cloud only so contact nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net to request materials.\n\n\nIntroduction to R and RStudio course materials\nThe Introduction to R and RStudio workshop materials can be found in a specific module. Click on the green Code button\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the GitHub download files page with the selection from the dropdown of Download zip highlighted\n\n\nThe zip includes the data files which will be used in the workshop.\nThe following code can be run from the Console in RStudio to download the same files:\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nusethis::use_course(\"nhs-r-community/intro_r_data\")\n\nDownloading slides\nIf you want to have the slides on your computer, they can be downloaded from the same repository as the intro-r files but on a branch called gh-pages. Using the same process as for Downloading files above you can download these to your computer by clicking on the green button and selecting the zip download.\n\n\n\nWorkshop confirmation emails\nThe NHS-R Community confirmation email will include:\n\nthe link to the workshop\nthe Posit Cloud specific workspace url and\na calendar invitation\n\nIf you are not sure that you can access Zoom from your work laptop, please request a test Zoom meeting coordinated by nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net.\n\n\nModern desktop users (NHS England)\nSome organisations are using a modern desktop system, please note that project do not appear to work with Projects/setwd and files like RMarkdown and Quarto don’t appear to work, giving the error:\n\nWarning message: In options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE) : ‘options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)’ is deprecated and will be disabled Error in setwd(“C:/R/WorkingDir”) : cannot change working directory Execution halted\n\nCurrently, the way around this is to create the missing folder “C:/R/WorkingDir” (so WorkingDir folder in a folder called R on the C: drive) and whilst the warning message will remain the report scripts .rmd and .qmd will work. The other recommendation is currently to work through UDAL if there is access."
