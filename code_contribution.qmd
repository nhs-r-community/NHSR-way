The NHS-R Community hosts all its code on our [GitHub site](https://github.com/nhs-r-community).

### _Not familiar or confident with Git or GitHub? No problem!_

If you'd like help submitting any suggested changes or additions to any of our code-based resources (like our books or website), [email us](#contact-us) or ask for help in the [NHS-R Slack](https://nhsrcommunity.com/getting-started.html#contact) group and a member of the community would be happy to help you get started!

If you spot any errors, have any suggested changes or additions you'd like to make to any of our code-based resources, you can [submit a Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Please ensure you follow our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)while doing so. If your PR concerns a bug you've found, you'll get a better response if you include a reproducible example and there is a package that can help called [{reprex}](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/). Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLfzNWh2dLI) on how to do this!

### How to submit a Pull Request

Before the instructions on what to do to contribute make sure you have Git installed on your computer and a GitHub account.
Details on how to get set up can be found in the [Introduction to Git and GitHub using R course](https://intro-git-github.nhsrcommunity.com/session-setup.html#/title-slide).

The first step to contributing is to `clone` the site to your own GitHub account.
As with many programs and coding there are numerous ways to do this but one nice way in R is to use the package {usethis}.

From your own repository you should create a new branch.
Again, using {usethis} you can follow the steps from the course <https://intro-git-github.nhsrcommunity.com/session-usethis-gert.html#/start-new-work> and then create a [pull request](https://intro-git-github.nhsrcommunity.com/session-pull-requests.html#/pushing-to-the-remote-github).

## PR to which repository? (tip)
By following these instructions you will have created a new branch in your repository so the PR (pull request) will go automatically to your own repository's `main` branch. 
You can either complete this which updates your `main` or redirect the PR in GitHub to the original NHS-R Community repository which will be possible as the two are linked.
