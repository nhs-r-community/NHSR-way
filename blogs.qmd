# Blogs ✍ {#blogs .unnumbered}


Tell us about your career, your work, your favourite packages, your R or open-source based journey, or anything you think the community would be interested in!

We'd love to receive blogs for the website and these can be emailed to [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/).

If you want to submit the blog as a Quarto document directly to the repository we'd love to receive a pull request from you (see [get involved](#get-involved) for tips on how).

See our [existing blogs](https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/) for tips on how to set your Quarto blog document up.

If you are writing a blog and are submitting this through a Pull Request in GitHub, please save a `.qmd` file into the folder called `blog` and any images you've used in the `img` sub-folder.
Also ensure that all images used have suitable [alternative text as good practice](https://design102.blog.gov.uk/2022/01/14/whats-the-alternative-how-to-write-good-alt-text/) and this will need to be a short description of the image.

The format for the header part of the `.qmd` YAML template is often set out like this:

```
---
title: "Your title here"
date: "17 October 2022"
date-modified: "27 July 2024"
categories:
  - Something
  - Something Else
author: Your name
image: img/picture.jpg
image-alt: "Please add a short description"
subtitle: >
  "Please add a short description of the blog if you'd like or remove this text"
---
```
The default for all blogs' YAML is:

```
execute:
  `eval: true
   echo: true
```

so is not necessary in the blogs themselves.
However, if you wish to change the default so the blog, for example, shows code but does not run it then the YAML needs the following added to the individual blog `.qmd` YAML:

```
execute: 
  eval: false
```

More details on the [execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) are available from the Quarto documentation website.
